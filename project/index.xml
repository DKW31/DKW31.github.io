Introduction: My original data consisted of 60 observations with 5 variables. The 5 variables were State, NFL Team, Superbowl appearances, Superbowl wins, and the conference,NFC or AFC, of the football team. I then added Superbowl win percentage, population of state,and a binary column with 1 indicating AFC conference and 0 indicating NFC conference. I then deleted the observations that did not have a football team or has never been to a Superbowl.</description>
